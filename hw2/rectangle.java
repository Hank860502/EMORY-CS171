//A class for a rectangle.

public class Rectangle{//save as Rectangle.java.

	 // private instance variable, not accessible from outside this class



	private double L;//the length of the rectangle
   private double H; //the height of the rectangle
   private double x;// The x coordinate of the  bottom left corner of the rectangle
   private double y; // the y coordinate of the bottom left corner of the rectangle


   //You should write a basic constructor that creates a rectangle with side lengths 1 whose bottom left corner is at (0.0,0.0)


   //Now write a constructor that takes all four inputs, named Ell, Eich, Ex, and Why for L, H, x, and y respectively. 

   //Write a method called getLenght which returns the length.

   //Write a method called getHeight which returns the height. 

   //Write a method called setLength which takes as input a double called Ell which sets the length of the rectangle.

   //write a method called setHeight which takes as input a double called Eich which sets the height of the rectangle.

   //write a method called perimeter which computes the perimeter of the rectangle. 

   //write a method called area which computes the area of the rectangle.
